# 1- Problem Statement

### Context
- Identify customer satisfaction is a key element for modern businesses as it can significantly contribute to a continuing effort of service quality improvement. In order to meet customer expectations and achieve higher quality levels, airlines needs to develop a specific mechanism of passenger satisfaction measurement.

- This is a <font color = 'steelblue' size=4>classification</font> supervised machine learning project, Predicting Satisfaction of Airline Passengers.

  - complete duplicates in the data?
  - outliers in each column?

- `Univariate Analysis`
1. What is the most common type of travel among passengers?
2. What is the average age of passengers?
3. What is the distribution of flight distances?
4. What percentage of passengers face delays between 20 minutes to 60 minutes?
5. Which services received good ratings from passengers?
6. Which services received poor ratings from passengers?
7. What is the overall satisfaction level of passengers?


- `Bivariate Questions`

1. How does age distribution differ among passengers based on their type of travel, satisfaction level, customer type, and class?
2. What are the characteristics of older and younger passengers?
3. How does flight distance distribution differ among passengers based on their type of travel, satisfaction level, customer type, and class?

# 4- Conclusion

### Age Distributions for Passengers
- `Older Passengers` tend to be:
    - `Satisfied`, `Returning Customers`, `Business Class`.

- `Younger Passengers` tend to be:
    - `Dissatisfied`, `First time Customers`, `Economy Class`.
- Age Distributed `Equally` for Passengers `Gender`.

### Flight distance Distributions for Passengers
- `Business` type of travel, `Satisfied` Passengers, `Business Class`, `Returning Customers`. All traveled long distances.

- `Gender` and `Total Time Delay` Categories have the same distribution for Kilometers Traveled.

### Categories
- `Returning` Customer type is almost `Equally` (satisfied & dissatisfied), but `First time` Customers `not satisfied at all`.

- `Business Class` is `More Satisfied`, unlike `Economy & Eco Plus` Class which is mostly `not satisfied`.

- `Business` Type of Travel is `More Satisfied`, unlike `Personal` type which is mostly `not satisfied`.

- `Gender` is almost `Equally` for Satisfied (or not) Men and Women.

### Services
- `In-Flight Service`, `Baggage Handling`, and `Seat Comfort` are the best 3 Services by Passengers Rating.

- `Wifi`, `Ease of Online Booking`, `Gate Location` services received poor ratings from Passengers.
- Service Rating for `Flight Classes`:
    - Overview: `Busniness Class` gives `higher ratings` for services.
    - `Gate location` got poor rating by `business class`.
    - `Time Delays` got poor rating by `business class`.
    - `Wifi` got `worst` rating by `economy class`, same as `online booking`.

- Service Rating for `Type of Customer`:
    - Overview: `Returning Customers` give `higher ratings`.
    - `Online boarding`, `Seat Comfort`, `In flight entertainment` received `High rating` for `Returning customers`, while got `poor Rating` for `first time customers`.

- Service Rating for `Satisfaction`:
    - Overview: `Satisfied` Passengers give `High Ratings` for services.
    - `Gate Location` service got `Moderate and Equal Rate` for both (Satisfied and dissatisfied) Passengers.

- Service Rating for `Gender`:

    - `Check in Service` got `Moderate and Equal Rate` for both (Personal and Business) type of Passengers.

### Delays
- `Strong` Relationship between Departure and Arrival Delay Times.

- `Total time delay` has no Relation with any of (type of Travel, Satisfaction, Gender, Class and Customer type), and is `distributed equally`.

# 5- ðŸ’¡ Best Model

- `Tree` based models exhibited a good fit for the data.
- The `XGBOOST` classifier achieved the highest training and validation `f1-scores`: `%95` and `%93`, respectively.
- The model tuning process was effective, selecting `11` as the `max-depth`, `100` for the number of `estimators`, and `0.1` as the `learning rate`.
- Model tuning resulted in impressive accuracy (f1-score) for both training and validation: `%98` and `%96`, respectively.
- Performance evaluation on the test dataset indicates the model's fitting capability, yielding `%96`, which suggests that the model doesn't suffer from overfitting and `fits well`.
